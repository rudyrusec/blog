## 2. Layered Defense Approach

**A Multi-Layered Strategy:**
Just like a fortress with multiple layers of defenses, a multi-layered approach provides comprehensive protection against bot attacks. This strategy includes several layers of security measures working together to detect, prevent, and mitigate bot activities.

- **Layer 1: Rate Limiting**

    - **Purpose:**
    Control the number of requests a user can make to your site within a specific timeframe to prevent bots from overwhelming your systems.

    - **Implementation:**
        - **Set Thresholds:** Define acceptable limits for various actions (e.g., login attempts, page requests).
        - **Dynamic Adjustments:** Adjust thresholds based on traffic patterns and user behavior.
        - **Tools:** Use web application firewalls (WAF) and rate-limiting services provided by CDNs.

    **Example:**
    {{< highlight sh >}}
    # Example using Nginx rate limiting

    http {
        limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=one:10m rate=1r/s;
        server {
            location /login {
                limit_req zone=one burst=5;
            }
        }
    }
    {{< /highlight >}}
- **Layer 2: CAPTCHAs**

    - **Purpose:**
    Differentiate between human users and bots by presenting challenges that are difficult for bots to solve.

    - **Implementation:**
        - **Invisible CAPTCHAs:** Use tools like Google's reCAPTCHA v3, which silently scores user interactions.
        - **Interactive CAPTCHAs:** Employ image-based or text-based challenges when suspicious behavior is detected.

        **Example:**
        Integrate reCAPTCHA v3 into your login form:
        {{< highlight html >}}
        <form action="/submit" method="POST">
            <div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="your_site_key"></div>
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
        <script src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js" async defer></script>
        {{< /highlight >}}
- **Layer 3: Device Fingerprinting**

        {{< highlight sh>}}
        # Example using Fail2ban to block bad IPs
        [DEFAULT]
        bantime = 600
        findtime = 600
        maxretry = 5

        [http-get-dos]
        enabled = true
        port = http,https
        filter = http-get-dos
        logpath = /var/log/nginx/access.log
        maxretry = 200
        {{< /highlight >}}

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Sample dataset
data = ...
labels = ...

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, labels, test_size=0.2)

# Train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))
